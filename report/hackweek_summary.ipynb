    "This table shows three algorithms that are implemented across several languages (Python, Julia, and Fortran). Each algorithm also has been used with an AD method as well. Where possible, we have compared the gradients generated by different AD methods on the same algorithm. In the case of the bulk formulae from Air Sea Fluxes, we have a toy problem that uses Enzyme and Optim (in Julia) to match the output of the formula to some observations. The table roughly summarizes what can be found on the EH24-ToyECCO repository.\n",

    "This work intends to inform users on how to use several AD tools within data assimilation, share the pros and cons of various AD tools in different languages, and to inform decisions about the appropriate tools to use for different problems. Future related work will include using Enzyme within the optimization package Optim in Julia to efficiently optimize data assimilation within toy models like the Air-Sea Flux calcultions and the Lorenz 96 model."
