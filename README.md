# Toy ECCO

## Introduction

Toy version of ECCO estimation problem in Julia, and benchmarking of AD tools including Enzyme and Tapenade, maybe Jax.

### Collaborators

Shreyas Gaikwad, Max Trostel, Ellen Davenport, GaÃ«l Forget

### The problem

AD tools are hard to compare across different languages and algorithms because they all require slightly different implementation. This is an attempt to get some basic examples working with comparisons across languages (Python, Fortran, Julia) and open source AD tools (Enzyme, PyTorch, JAX, Tapenade).
